# Zoom Native Room Controls Preview

## Description

Zoom [Native Room Controls](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360033716572-Zoom-Rooms-Native-Room-Controls) allows a programmer to control third-party equipment from the Zoom app. The programmer writes a json file using the specifications detailed at the link above, loads that json into the Zoom web portal, and the buttons show up on the Zoom app.

There are a few tools to help create that json file (like [this one](https://controlconcepts.net/zoom/) from Control Concepts), but I've not found one that shows you what your end result will look like to the end user. Since many programmers do not have access to the Zoom web portal until the final commissioning step, I wanted to create a tool that would make previewing that user interface easier.

## Using the app

The app is currently live [here](https://zoom.jeffmcaleer.com).
